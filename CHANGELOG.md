# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## GA (General Availability) - 2025-01-XX

### ðŸŽ‰ Major Milestones
- **Full E2E compatibility with Go sing-box**: All route/check/version/dns/selector/bench JSON outputs are field-for-field compatible
- **Production-ready performance baselines**: Automated regression detection with Â±8% latency and Â±5% throughput tolerance
- **Complete license compliance**: Third-party dependency audit with automated SBOM generation
- **Robust config migration**: Full v1â†’v2 schema migration with graceful unknown field handling
- **Release quality gates**: Preflight verification with digest validation and consistent toolchain verification

### âœ¨ New Features
- Performance baseline recording and regression guard system (`scripts/bench-guard.sh`)
- Comprehensive license inventory with third-party dependency tracking (`LICENSES/THIRD-PARTY.md`)
- Enhanced config compatibility matrix with 6 comprehensive test variants (3Ã—v1 + 3Ã—v2)
- Version command now includes license information and build metadata
- Release workflow with preflight dependency verification and artifact integrity checking

### ðŸ”§ Migration Guide
- **v1â†’v2 Config Migration**: Run `check --migrate --write-normalized your-config.yml`
  - Unknown fields now generate warnings (not errors) with `--allow-unknown`
  - Schema validation maintains backward compatibility
- **Performance Monitoring**: Use `scripts/bench-guard.sh --record` to establish baseline, then `--check` for regression detection
- **License Compliance**: All executables now embed license information accessible via `--version`

### ðŸ§ª Testing & Quality
- E2E test coverage with differential analysis against Go reference implementation
- Config compatibility matrix with comprehensive v1/v2 migration testing
- Performance regression detection with statistical tolerance thresholds
- Preflight checks ensure release consistency and artifact integrity

- Unify error mapping to SbError in sb-adapters/sb-api (P22).
- Add Loom and Miri smoke tests (P23) and CI jobs.
- Add dev-only benches and bench script exporting CSV (P24).
- Add release draft workflow building cross-platform artifacts (P25).
- Documentation refactor completed; see docs/COOKBOOK.md for migration notes and runnable snippets (P27).
