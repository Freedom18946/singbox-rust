## Unreleased

### üî® Architecture Refactoring & TODO Resolution
- **VLESS Protocol Support**: ‚úÖ Added VLESS variant to OutboundImpl enum to complete protocol matrix
  - *Rationale*: Previously using Direct as placeholder, impacting protocol accuracy
  - *Implementation*: Added proper VLESS enum variant with configuration mapping from sb-config to sb-core
  - *Result*: VLESS configurations now properly instantiate VlessConfig instead of falling back to Direct
- **Bridge Runtime Initialization**: ‚úÖ Implemented proper Bridge initialization from IR
  - *Rationale*: Current Bridge::new() creates empty bridge, missing IR-based configuration
  - *Implementation*: Enhanced Bridge::new_from_config to construct inbound/outbound services from ConfigIR
  - *Result*: Runtime now properly initializes bridge with configured inbound/outbound services from IR
- **DNS Cache Architecture Cleanup**: ‚úÖ Resolved cache key design inconsistency
  - *Rationale*: Cache API uses domain-only keys but creates query-type-specific keys internally
  - *Implementation*: Unified cache key design using Key struct (domain + QType) throughout DNS cache API
  - *Result*: A and AAAA records now have separate cache entries, eliminating shared cache conflicts
- **Dependency Architecture**: ‚úÖ Preserved clean dependency boundaries to avoid circular dependencies
  - *Rationale*: sb-config should not depend on sb-core to maintain clear module boundaries
  - *Implementation*: Moved VLESS configuration processing from sb-config to sb-core, maintaining unidirectional dependency
  - *Result*: Clean architecture with sb-core depending on sb-config but not vice versa
- **Runtime Supervisor Configuration Diff**: ‚úÖ Implemented proper old-IR extraction for accurate reload diff computation
  - *Rationale*: Hot reload diff computation was using `new_ir.clone()` as placeholder for old IR, preventing meaningful change detection
  - *Problem Analysis*:
    - State struct lacked storage of current ConfigIR
    - `reload()` method couldn't access previous configuration for comparison
    - Diff computation was essentially comparing config against itself (no-op)
  - *Implementation*:
    - Added `current_ir: ConfigIR` field to both router and non-router State variants
    - Modified `State::new()` to accept and store initial ConfigIR
    - Updated `reload()` to extract old_ir from state before applying new configuration
    - Enhanced `handle_reload()` and `handle_reload_no_router()` to update current_ir atomically during state transitions
    - Added structured logging for diff metrics (inbounds/outbounds added/removed) when `SB_RUNTIME_DIFF=1`
  - *Result*:
    - Hot reload now correctly computes delta between actual old and new configurations
    - Diff metrics accurately reflect configuration changes for monitoring/debugging
    - State transitions maintain IR consistency for future reloads
    - Memory overhead: single ConfigIR clone (~KB range for typical configs)
  - *Files Modified*: `crates/sb-core/src/runtime/supervisor.rs`

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Debt & Future Integration Points

The following TODO items represent intentional architectural placeholders that require system-wide abstractions not yet fully implemented:

- **V2Ray API Handler Service Integration** (`crates/sb-api/src/v2ray/services.rs`)
  - *Current State*: HandlerService methods (add/remove/alter inbound/outbound) return success with logging only
  - *Required Architecture*:
    - Global InboundManager trait to dynamically add/remove/configure inbound listeners
    - Global OutboundManager trait to dynamically add/remove/configure outbound connectors
    - Thread-safe registry accessible from V2Ray gRPC service handlers
  - *Design Considerations*:
    - Hot reload currently handled by Supervisor at config-file level (replace entire state)
    - Runtime inbound/outbound modification requires finer-grained control
    - Must maintain consistency with ConfigIR-based initialization
  - *Integration Path*:
    1. Define `InboundManager` and `OutboundManager` traits in sb-core
    2. Implement registry in Bridge or create separate ManagerRegistry
    3. Pass Arc<dyn Manager> to HandlerServiceImpl::new()
    4. Replace TODO logging with actual manager method calls
  - *Files Affected*: 6 TODO sites in add/remove/alter methods

- **TUN Inbound Router Integration** (`crates/sb-adapters/src/inbound/tun_enhanced.rs:458`)
  - *Current State*: TUN inbound directly uses configured outbound without routing
  - *Required Architecture*:
    - Router interface to make per-connection routing decisions
    - Connection context enrichment (source IP, destination, protocol)
  - *Design Considerations*:
    - Current design: EnhancedTunInbound holds single Arc<dyn OutboundConnector>
    - Correct design: Should query router for outbound selection per connection
    - Requires Router trait accessible from TUN packet handler
  - *Integration Path*:
    1. Add optional router: Option<Arc<dyn Router>> field to EnhancedTunInbound
    2. In handle_tcp_connection/handle_udp_packet, call router.route(&ctx) to select outbound
    3. Fall back to default outbound if router absent (backward compat)
  - *Files Affected*: TCP/UDP connection handling in tun_enhanced.rs

- **Monitoring Bridge Integration** (`crates/sb-api/src/monitoring/bridge.rs:267`)
  - *Current State*: Monitoring bridge returns mock metrics
  - *Required Integration*: Wire to actual runtime state, connection tracker, router metrics
  - *Future Work*: Connect to Supervisor state, Bridge statistics, and Engine routing metrics
