## Remaining Work

### Phase 3 Priorities (Current)

**High Priority:**
1. ✅ **Mixed Inbound** - HTTP+SOCKS5 hybrid listener (COMPLETE)
2. ✅ **SSH Outbound** - thrussh-based tunnel with pooling (COMPLETE)
3. ⏸️ **WireGuard Outbound** - Deferred (requires boringtun library integration)

**Medium Priority:**
4. **Redirect Inbound** - Transparent proxy support for iptables/nftables integration
5. **Protocol optimizations** - Performance tuning and zero-copy optimizations
6. **Comprehensive testing** - Integration tests with reference implementations
7. **Process Rules** - Process name/path-based routing (platform-specific)

## Implementation Progress
