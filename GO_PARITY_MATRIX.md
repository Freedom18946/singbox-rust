Sing-Box Parity Matrix (Baseline v1.12.4; CLI synced 1.13 alpha)

Status legend
- Full: Feature implemented and usable end-to-end
- Partial: Implemented with gaps or limited coverage (needs work)
- Stub: Present as placeholder but not functional
- Missing: Not implemented
- N/A: Not applicable to Rust implementation or intentionally out-of-scope

Baseline
- Upstream: SagerNet/sing-box v1.12.4 stable; latest pre-release v1.13.0-alpha.19 (2025-10-05). Source snapshot vendored under `upstream-sing-box/`.
- Local: this repository (modules under `crates/`), config schema v2 (`crates/sb-config/src/validator/v2_schema.json`).
- Goal: CLI behavior and config surface compatible with upstream; functional parity prioritized by user impact.

Platform/Adapters

- WireGuard endpoint: Stub/Missing
- Tailscale endpoint: Missing

Notes
- Upstream features tagged `with_utls`, `with_wireguard`, or Tailscale-specific components are Go-ecosystem centric; Rust equivalents require separate libraries and may be prioritized based on demand.
- Some modules exist in both `sb-core` and `sb-adapters`; convergence is required to avoid duplication and ensure uniform configuration and behavior.
- Extra helper added: `geosite matcher` subcommand (reads domains from stdin and reports first match) to aid debugging.

New items observed upstream (1.13 alpha CLI snapshot)
- New subcommands present upstream and tracked for parity:
  - `generate vapid`, `generate wireguard`
  - `rule-set convert`, `rule-set decompile`, `rule-set merge`, `rule-set upgrade` (now implemented here)
  - `geosite list/export/lookup/matcher`, `geoip list/export/lookup`
  - `tools fetch-http3`

Verification summary (2025-10-05)
- Upstream latest: v1.13.0-alpha.19 (GitHub releases); stable baseline v1.12.4.
- Upstream CLI inventory verified from vendored `upstream-sing-box/cmd/sing-box/*`.
- Local CLI inventory verified from `app/src/bin` and `app/src/cli`.
- Rule-Set CLI parity upgraded to Full (compile/convert/merge/upgrade now implemented).
- SSH outbound wired via IR + adapter bridge (password/private-key auth).
 - New 1.13 features validated: AnyTLS (inbound/outbound) present upstream; `generate vapid`/`generate wireguard` present upstream; DNS `server.tailscale`/`server.dhcp` present upstream.
