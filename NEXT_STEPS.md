## Key Insights from Kiro Audit

### What We Learned

1. **TLS was the critical blocker**: Completing REALITY, ECH, and Standard TLS unblocked 15+ protocols
2. **CLI parity is high**: Most CLI commands implemented, just need matrix documentation updates
3. **Protocol coverage is strong**: 33.3% of inbounds, 35.3% of outbounds functionally complete
4. **Foundation gaps remain**: DNS (0%), Routing (0%), V2Ray transports (0%), Clash API (2.3%)

### Strategic Pivot

**Before Sprint 5**: Focus was scattered across protocols
**After Sprint 5**: Clear path forward with TLS foundation complete

**New strategy**:
1. Leverage TLS to complete protocol stack (Sprint 6)
2. Build foundation systems in parallel (Sprints 7-10)
3. Achieve 50%+ total coverage by Q2 2025

### Resource Allocation (Updated)

Based on kiro audit recommendations and Sprint 5 breakthroughs:
- **35%** effort ‚Üí Multiplex + V2Ray transports (highest priority, TLS complete)
- **30%** effort ‚Üí DNS + Routing engine (critical for production)
- **20%** effort ‚Üí Protocol integration (leveraging new TLS/transport infrastructure)
- **15%** effort ‚Üí APIs, Services, CLI polish
