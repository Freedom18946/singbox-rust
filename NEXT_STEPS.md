  - Add hosts override and per-domain bootstrap options
  - Add DHCP DNS server backend (`dns.servers[].type = "dhcp"`)
  - **Defer**: Tailscale DNS server (mark as N/A or implement equivalent if feasible)
  - Extend DNS rule actions to parity with upstream

  - Implement rule-set support (local + remote with caching)
  - Consolidate keyword/regex conditions ergonomics
  - Ensure rule-set remote caching and failure policies match upstream semantics

**Status**: Lower priority; evaluate based on user demand

- WireGuard outbound/endpoint
  - Replace stub with functional implementation or provide clear N/A rationale
  - Add interop tests with upstream Go sing-box
  - Consider using boringtun or wireguard-rs libraries

- Tailscale endpoint/DNS server integration
  - Research Rust bindings and security posture
  - Revisit based on demand and community interest

- uTLS alternative
  - Investigate Rust-side ClientHello mimic options (TLS fingerprint customization)
  - Document trade-offs if not feasible
  - Consider forking/porting relevant Go uTLS functionality

- Anytls protocol support
  - Requires external Rust library (upstream uses github.com/anytls/sing-anytls)
  - See `.kiro/specs/p0-production-parity/anytls-research.md` for investigation notes

## Key Insights from Kiro Audit

### What We Learned

1. **TLS was the critical blocker**: Completing REALITY, ECH, and Standard TLS unblocked 15+ protocols
2. **CLI parity is high**: Most CLI commands implemented, just need matrix documentation updates
3. **Protocol coverage is strong**: 33.3% of inbounds, 35.3% of outbounds functionally complete
4. **Foundation gaps remain**: DNS (0%), Routing (0%), V2Ray transports (0%), Clash API (2.3%)

### Strategic Pivot

**Before Sprint 5**: Focus was scattered across protocols
**After Sprint 5**: Clear path forward with TLS foundation complete

**New strategy**:
1. Leverage TLS to complete protocol stack (Sprint 6)
2. Build foundation systems in parallel (Sprints 7-10)
3. Achieve 50%+ total coverage by Q2 2025

### Resource Allocation (Updated)

Based on kiro audit recommendations and Sprint 5 breakthroughs:
- **35%** effort â†’ Multiplex + V2Ray transports (highest priority, TLS complete)
- **30%** effort â†’ DNS + Routing engine (critical for production)
- **20%** effort â†’ Protocol integration (leveraging new TLS/transport infrastructure)
- **15%** effort â†’ APIs, Services, CLI polish
