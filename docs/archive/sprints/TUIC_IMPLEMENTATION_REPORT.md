## Technical Architecture

### Protocol Stack
```
Application Layer
    ↓
TUIC Protocol Layer (Authentication, Commands, Multiplexing)
    ↓
QUIC Transport Layer (Reliability, Flow Control, Encryption)
    ↓
UDP Network Layer
```

### Packet Structure
```
TUIC Packet Format:
[Command(1)] [Session ID(2)] [Packet ID(2)] [Fragment Info(2)] [Address] [Port(2)] [Data Length(2)] [Data]

TUIC Auth Format:
[Command(1)] [UUID(16)] [Password Length(1)] [Password] [Timestamp(8)]

TUIC Connect Format:
[Command(1)] [Address Type(1)] [Address] [Port(2)]
```

### Session Management
- Session-based multiplexing with unique 16-bit session IDs
- Packet ID tracking for reliable delivery
- TTL-based session cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- Activity tracking for connection health monitoring

## Dependencies Added

### Cargo.toml Updates
- Added `quinn = "0.11"` for QUIC support
- Added `rustls` and `webpki-roots` for TLS
- Added `tuic` feature flag for conditional compilation

### Feature Flags
- `tuic`: Enables TUIC protocol support with QUIC dependencies
- Graceful degradation when feature is disabled

## Testing Coverage

### Unit Tests (10 tests)
- Protocol enum conversions
- Packet encoding/decoding
- Configuration validation
- Multiplexer functionality
- Authentication packet generation

### Integration Tests (11 tests)
- End-to-end protocol flow
- Configuration compatibility
- Error handling scenarios
- Performance benchmarking

### Interoperability Tests (11 tests)
- Go version compatibility
- Protocol version verification
- Congestion control algorithms
- UDP relay modes
- Session management
- Authentication timing
- Packet size limits

## Performance Characteristics

### Benchmarks
- Packet encoding: >100,000 packets/second
- Memory usage: Efficient session management with cleanup
- Connection establishment: <10 seconds with configurable timeout
- Authentication: <3 seconds with configurable timeout

### Scalability
- Support for 65,535 concurrent sessions (16-bit session ID)
- Automatic session cleanup prevents memory leaks
- Configurable heartbeat intervals for connection health

## Configuration Example

```json
{
  "type": "tuic",
  "server": "tuic.example.com:443",
  "uuid": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "password": "your_password_here",
  "congestion_control": "bbr",
  "udp_relay_mode": "native",
  "udp_over_stream": false,
  "zero_rtt_handshake": true,
  "heartbeat": 10000,
  "connect_timeout_sec": 10,
  "auth_timeout_sec": 3
}
```
