This directory contains **historical documentation** that is no longer actively maintained but preserved for reference.

## ⚠️ Important Notice

**Documents in this archive are NOT updated and may contain outdated information.**

For current documentation, please refer to the main docs directory.

## 📁 Archive Structure

### `/sprints/`

Sprint reports from development cycles (Sprint 9-19). These document historical progress and implementation details during active development phases.

- Sprint reports capture completed work, technical decisions, and implementation notes
- Useful for understanding the evolution of features
- **Not updated** - reflects state at time of completion

### `/tasks/`

Individual task completion reports and implementation summaries.

- Task-specific implementation details
- Technical investigation reports
- Historical reference only

### `/phases/`

Phase-based project planning documents (Phase 8 RC preparation, etc.).

- Release candidate preparation checklists
- Phase-specific quality gates
- **Superseded** by current development practices

### `/deprecated/`

Deprecated documentation that has been replaced or merged into other documents.

- Documents that no longer represent current architecture
- Merged content (now part of consolidated guides)
- Keep for historical reference only

## 🔍 When to Reference Archive

Archive documents may be useful when:

1. **Investigating Historical Decisions**: Understanding why certain technical choices were made
2. **Feature Evolution**: Tracing how a feature developed over time
3. **Technical Archaeology**: Debugging issues that originated in earlier versions
4. **Learning from Past**: Understanding what approaches were tried and refined
