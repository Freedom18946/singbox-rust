# Task 15 Completion Report: Process-Based Routing Rules

## Overview

Task 15 has been successfully completed. This task implemented process-based routing rules that allow routing decisions to be made based on the process name and path of the application that initiated the connection.

## Implementation Summary

### 1. Core Components Implemented

#### Process Matching Infrastructure (`crates/sb-platform/src/process/`)
- **ProcessMatcher**: Main interface for cross-platform process identification
- **ProcessInfo**: Structure containing process name, path, and PID
- **ConnectionInfo**: Structure for connection details (local/remote addresses, protocol)
- **Platform-specific implementations**:
  - **Linux** (`linux.rs`): Uses `/proc` filesystem for process identification
  - **macOS** (`macos.rs`): Uses system calls with `lsof` fallback
  - **Windows** (`windows.rs`): Uses `netstat` and `tasklist`/`wmic`

#### Routing Engine Extensions (`crates/sb-core/src/router/`)
- **Extended RuleKind enum**: Added `ProcessName` and `ProcessPath` variants
- **Extended RouteCtx**: Added `process_name` and `process_path` fields
- **Updated Engine**: Added process rule storage and matching logic
- **ProcessRouter**: High-level interface combining process matching with routing

#### Rule Parsing Support
- **Extended parse_rules function**: Added support for `process_name:` and `process_path:` prefixes
- **Rule priority**: Process rules have priority 7 (after port rules, before default)

### 2. Key Features

#### Process Identification
- **Cross-platform support**: Linux, macOS, and Windows
- **Caching mechanism**: 30-second TTL cache for process information
- **Error handling**: Graceful fallback when process matching fails
- **High accuracy target**: >95% accuracy requirement when system resources are accessible

#### Routing Integration
- **Seamless integration**: Process rules work alongside existing domain, IP, and port rules
- **Priority system**: Maintains existing rule priority order with process rules at priority 7
- **Fallback support**: Continues routing without process info if matching fails

#### Rule Syntax
```
process_name:firefox=proxy:browser_proxy
process_path:/usr/bin/curl=direct
process_name:chrome,port:443=proxy:secure_proxy
```

### 3. Architecture Compliance

The implementation follows the architecture specifications from `archi_docs_patched_v2`:

- **Clean separation**: Platform-specific code isolated in `sb-platform` crate
- **Consistent interfaces**: Uses standard `Result<T, E>` error handling
- **Async support**: All operations are async-compatible
- **Memory efficiency**: Uses caching to avoid repeated system calls
- **Error resilience**: Graceful degradation when process matching unavailable

### 4. Testing Coverage

#### Unit Tests
- Process matcher creation and basic functionality
- Rule parsing and validation
- Cache management and cleanup
- Cross-platform compatibility checks

#### Integration Tests (`crates/sb-core/tests/router_process_rules_integration.rs`)
- Process name and path routing
- Rule priority verification
- Mixed rule scenarios
- Engine updates and cache management
- Rule parsing from text format

#### Example Code (`crates/sb-core/examples/process_routing_demo.rs`)
- Comprehensive demonstration of process routing features
- Rule creation and parsing examples
- Priority system explanation
- Platform compatibility notes

### 5. Performance Characteristics

#### Process Matching Performance
- **Cache hit**: O(1) lookup for recently matched processes
- **Cache miss**: Platform-dependent system call overhead
- **Memory usage**: Bounded by cache size and TTL
- **Cleanup**: Automatic expired entry removal

#### Routing Performance
- **Rule evaluation**: O(1) for process rules (hash map lookup)
- **Priority order**: Maintains existing performance characteristics
- **Fallback cost**: Minimal overhead when process matching fails

### 6. Platform-Specific Implementation Details

#### Linux Implementation
- **Connection identification**: Parses `/proc/net/tcp` and `/proc/net/udp`
- **Process lookup**: Scans `/proc/*/fd/*` for socket inodes
- **Process info**: Reads `/proc/PID/comm` and `/proc/PID/exe`
- **Fallback**: Uses `/proc/PID/cmdline` when exe link unavailable

#### macOS Implementation
- **Connection identification**: Uses `lsof` command with protocol filters
- **Process info**: Uses `ps` command for process details
- **Future enhancement**: Could use proper system call bindings (libproc)

#### Windows Implementation
- **Connection identification**: Uses `netstat -ano` command
- **Process info**: Uses `tasklist` and `wmic` commands
- **Future enhancement**: Could use Windows API directly (GetExtendedTcpTable)

### 7. Error Handling and Resilience

#### Error Types
- `UnsupportedPlatform`: For unsupported operating systems
- `ProcessNotFound`: When process cannot be identified
- `PermissionDenied`: When system access is restricted
- `SystemError`: For general system-level errors
- `IoError`: For file system and command execution errors

#### Graceful Degradation
- Process matching failures don't break routing
- Falls back to non-process rules when process info unavailable
- Continues operation with reduced functionality rather than failing

### 8. Configuration and Usage

#### Basic Usage
```rust
use sb_core::router::process_router::ProcessRouter;
use sb_core::router::rules::{Engine, Rule, RuleKind, Decision};

// Create process-aware router
let rules = vec![
    Rule {
        kind: RuleKind::ProcessName("firefox".to_string()),
        decision: Decision::Proxy(Some("browser_proxy".to_string())),
    },
    // ... more rules
];

let engine = Engine::build(rules);
let router = ProcessRouter::new(engine)?;

// Make routing decision with process matching
let decision = router.decide_with_process(
    Some("example.com"),
    None,
    false,
    Some(443),
    local_addr,
    remote_addr,
).await;
```

#### Rule File Format
```
# Process-based rules
process_name:firefox=proxy:browser_proxy
process_path:/usr/bin/curl=direct

# Mixed rules (creates separate rules for each condition)
process_name:chrome,port:443=proxy:secure_proxy

# Standard rules continue to work
exact:example.com=reject
default=direct
```

### 9. Future Enhancements

#### Performance Optimizations
- **Native system calls**: Replace command-line tools with direct API calls
- **Connection tracking**: Maintain persistent connection-to-process mappings
- **Batch processing**: Group multiple process lookups for efficiency

#### Feature Extensions
- **Process group matching**: Match by process group or parent process
- **User-based rules**: Route based on process owner
- **Command line matching**: Match based on process arguments
- **Process state filtering**: Consider process state (running, sleeping, etc.)

#### Platform Support
- **FreeBSD/OpenBSD**: Extend support to BSD variants
- **Android/iOS**: Mobile platform support
- **Container awareness**: Docker/Kubernetes process identification
